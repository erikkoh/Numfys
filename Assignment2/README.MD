Most of the work is done in the Project notebook, however before running the nootbook Checking_points.jl needs to be run to generate the data.
The python libaries are highlited in the first cell in the notebook.
To install the required libaries for the julia part of the code use requirements.jl
Part of the project was coded with help from LLM.
